# 🌲 Outdoor Tracker

A production-ready single-page React application for hunters, anglers, hikers, and campers to securely log outdoor trips with automatic weather data, interactive maps, and personal notes.

**Live Demo:** [https://your-app.vercel.app](https://your-app.vercel.app) ← replace after deploying

---

## Problem Statement

Hunters and anglers rely on memory, handwritten notes, or multiple disconnected apps to track where they found game, caught fish, or discovered great spots. **Outdoor Tracker** solves this by combining location tracking, weather conditions, and personal trip logs in one secure, easy-to-use application. Users can log trips, record catches, review past conditions, and use that data to plan better future outings.

## Setup & Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AustinNovak/Final-Project-Part-2-MVP.git
cd Final-Project-Part-2-MVP

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the development server

## Available Routes

| Route | Access | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Public | Home dashboard — hero, features, recent trips |
| `/login` | Public | Sign in to your account |
| `/register` | Public | Create a new account |
| `/about` | Public | About the app and tech stack |
| `/log` | 🔐 Protected | Log a new trip (2-step form) |
| `/trips` | 🔐 Protected | All trips with filter + search |
| `/trips/:id` | 🔐 Protected | Full trip detail — map, weather, notes |

Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`, which remembers the intended destination and redirects back after sign-in.

## Authentication System

Outdoor Tracker implements a frontend JWT-style authentication pattern:

- **Registration:** User submits name, email, password → password is hashed → user stored in localStorage → JWT-style token generated and saved to **sessionStorage**
- **Login:** Credentials checked against stored hash → new token issued → saved to sessionStorage
- **Session Restore:** On page load, token is read from sessionStorage and decoded → if valid and not expired (24-hour TTL), user is restored automatically
- **Logout:** Token removed from sessionStorage, global auth state cleared
- **Protected Routes:** `ProtectedRoute` component checks auth state before rendering; unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`

### Security Practices

- Tokens stored in **sessionStorage** (cleared on tab close, not accessible cross-tab)
- **XSS prevention:** `sanitizeInput()` strips HTML tags and encodes dangerous characters on all user text inputs
- **CSRF protection:** Forms generate and validate a CSRF token via `generateCsrfToken()` / `validateCsrfToken()`
- Passwords are never stored in plain text — hashed before localStorage persistence

| `TripContext.test.jsx` | addTrip, deleteTrip, localStorage persistence, error boundary |
| `TripCard.test.jsx` | Rendering, links, weather display, trip types, visibility icons |
| `MyTrips.test.jsx` | Filter by type, search, empty states, navigation |
| `Header.test.jsx` | Nav links, hamburger menu, active states |

> - Register / Login forms
> - Log Trip form (step 1 and 2)
> - My Trips grid with filters
> - Trip detail with map and weather

## Known Issues / Limitations

- Authentication is entirely client-side — data is not synced across devices or browsers. A backend (Node + PostgreSQL) is planned for the full-stack version.
- Trip data is scoped to the browser's localStorage, not to the logged-in user account. Multi-user support requires a real backend.

---

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Backend API (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL) for persistent, cross-device data
- [ ] Photo upload for catches and sightings
- [ ] Favorites / saved locations list
- [ ] Species database integration (USGS fishing regulations)
- [ ] Export trip log as PDF
- [ ] Social sharing of public trips
- [ ] Trip statistics dashboard (best locations, seasonal trends)
- [ ] Push notifications for weather alerts at saved locations
